Task 1 
Please write three functions that convert an angle value given in degrees to radians.  
- The first function should use pass-by-value parameters.  
- The second function should use pass-by-reference parameters.  
- The third function should use pointer parameters.  

Also, write test code that demonstrates the functionality of these functions.  

Task 2 
Please write a function implementing quicksort that uses pointers to pass parameters to the function.
