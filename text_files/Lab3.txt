Task 1 
Please review the example program from the end of lecture #9 that uses the `TMatrix` class.  
- Run the program and trace its execution.  
- Complete the definition of the `TMatrix` class so that it actually stores the matrix data.  
- Additionally, write the following functions:  
  - `add` – for adding matrices.  
  - `mult` – for multiplying matrices.  
  - Complete the functions:  
    - `OrphanRandomMatrix` – to generate a random matrix.  
    - `ComputeDeterminant` – to compute the determinant of the matrix.  
    - `TakeOverAndProcessMatrix` and `AcceptAndProcessMatrix` – to perform any operations on the matrix.  
- Use `std::unique_ptr` instead of `std::vector`.
