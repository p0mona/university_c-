Task 1  
Please extend the example of the factory method from lecture #10 so that it demonstrates object creation for an additional class `F` that inherits from class `B`.  

Task 2
Please create a class for a doubly linked queue (`Deque`) that will store objects of type `String` and have the following methods:  
- `addFirst(e)` – to add an element at the front of the deque.  
- `removeFirst()` – to remove the element from the front of the deque.  
- `getFirst()` – to return the element at the front of the deque.  
- `addLast(e)` – to add an element at the end of the deque.  
- `removeLast()` – to remove the element from the end of the deque.  
- `getLast()` – to return the element at the end of the deque.
